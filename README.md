# 🚀 Deploy Your React Front-End on AWS EC2 in Minutes! 🖥

🔑 **AWS Secrets & Access Keys + 🌐 GitHub URL of Your React Project** = Fully Automated EC2 t2.micro Deployment in Your AWS Account, Containerized and Ready to Go! 🎉

## Overview

This project provides a streamlined solution for deploying React applications using AWS and Docker. By entering your AWS credentials and GitHub repository URL, you can have your React app up and running on a containerized EC2 instance in just minutes!

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Input Your Credentials**: Provide your AWS access keys and the GitHub URL of your React project.
2. **Terraform Deployment**: Terraform will spin up an EC2 t2.micro instance for you.
3. **Automated Setup**: Your React app is cloned from GitHub, built, and deployed in a Docker container on the EC2 instance.

## 💡 Why It Matters

- **Speed**: Deploy your application in minutes with minimal manual setup.
- **Simplicity**: No need to manually configure infrastructure or containerize your app.
- **Cost-Effective**: Utilize AWS Free Tier with the t2.micro instance.

## 📍 Access Your Application

After deployment, access your application using the IP address of your EC2 instance. The format is:  
`http://<ec2-ip>/`  
*(Replace `<ec2-ip>` with the actual IP address assigned to your EC2 instance.)*
